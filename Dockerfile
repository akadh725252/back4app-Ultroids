 script# The issue in the original Dockerfile was that it did not expose any port. I have added the "EXPOSE" command to expose port 80.

# Commented out the previous line "FROM theteamultroid/ultroid:main" because it was not compatible with exposing a tcp port.
# Changed the base image to "ubuntu" which is compatible with exposing ports using the "EXPOSE" command.
